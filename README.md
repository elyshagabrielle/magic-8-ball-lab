### Why wait for the rest of the world to remember that the toys of generations past are still ~all the rage~ when you could build them yourself... VR style.

###### Magic-8 Balls have been sold from 1950, and it's time we gave our old fortune telling friend an upgrade. Design your very own virtual reality magic 8-ball.
1. Your MVP should shake and display a response when you click on it. Feel free to get creative with your magic-8-ballâ€™s possible responses. Whatever you choose to make your responses make sure that the one being displayed is randomized. 
2. Let's make our magic 8 ball LOOK like the truly life changing, future predicting, very addicting toy that it is. 
    * Figure out how to make your sphere see through and place a triangle inside that will have your text displayed on it.
    * Make your triangle move forward so you can see the text perfectly once your ball is done shaking
    * For an extra challenge, make it so your triangle only stays in this forward position long enough for your use to read their fortune, it should then return to its original location.
    * Have your triangle spin inside your ball as it shakes. 
3. Add some mood music to your game, build the suspense with some intense background music.
4. Try out the textwrap component for A-frame to get your text to perfectly stay on your triangle. You'll need to create copies of the aframe-textwrap-component.js and include a script tag for it as well as the aframe-draw-component.js(you'll have to Google this separately). Add two script tags to your html linking these files in and then follow the given example for the textwrap component to get it working. Ignore the instructions on how to install the component; including the files will take care of that.
